## Project Retrospective & Key Learnings

Building this portfolio provided practical insights into the full development lifecycle of a frontend application. Below are the primary challenges addressed during the process:

-   **Website Performance:**
    -   **Challenge:** Balancing rich media content with the need for near-instant load times and SEO compliance.
    -   **Solution:** Utilized Google Lighthouse to identify bottlenecks. Implemented modern image formats, lazy loading, and asset optimization to maintain a 95+ performance score.

-   **Information Architecture:**
    -   **Challenge:** Recruiters often have limited time to find key information. The UI needed to facilitate a "30-second scan."
    -   **Solution:** Prioritized high-impact information and removed redundant details. Used a logical content flow and clean typography to guide the user's eye toward my core competencies.

-   **Deployment & Security:**
    -   **Challenge:** Deploying a professional-grade site with a custom domain and ensuring reliable uptime.
    -   **Solution:** Successfully configured a custom domain with a reliable hosting provider, ensuring the site is secure (HTTPS) and always available to visitors.
